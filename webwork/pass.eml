Hi Peter,

Math Webwork is now active for the Winter 2018 quarter. The main Webwork 
page is

http://homework.ps.uci.edu select your class and course number to access 
the login page.

Note: To Access the Webwork site from off campus or student housing you 
need to install and use the VPN client software.

http://www.oit.uci.edu/security/vpn/

Do not use the WebVPN link.

Please let the students know that Webwork is now active and that their 
login is their UCInetID lowercase
  and their password is their UCInetID password.
  Please have students that do not have a UCInetID use the help form or 
contact us at
webworkmath@ps.uci.edu, so that we can setup their Webwork access.

The main thing is for them to use the help form and NOT email you if 
they can't access Webwork.

The first assignment has been posted and is now available for students.
The due date for the first assignment is 01/26 at 11:00pm. The 
assignments are due Fridays at 11:00pm.

Please have the students look at the section How To Enter Answers in Webwork
located on the main Webwork page http://homework.ps.uci.edu

Please let your students know that if they have added late, changed
class sections, or have any problems with Webwork they should use the 
help form on the main
Webwork page to let us know.

The following are your logins and passwords.

Please let your TAs know their logins and passwords.
