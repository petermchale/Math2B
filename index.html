Office Hours: Mon 2-4 pm, Wed 2-4 pm

Office Location: Rowland Hall 419

Discussion Sections:

8 am 44201 in PSCB 120

11 am 44202 in MSTB 124

The first meeting for both sections is on Tue Apr 4.

TEACHING ASSISTANT 2

Matt Gibson

Email: gibsonmd@uci.edu

Office Hours: TuTh 2-4pm

Office Location: Rowland Hall 480C

Discussion Section: 44203 (1pm) / 44204 (5pm)  

EMAIL

In a class this big, it is unreasonable to expect that the Instructor and TAs will remember you and your particular story. When writing an email to the Instructor and TAs, please retain the history of any prior email exchanges by finding the last email that you received from us (in that thread) and hitting the "Reply" key in your email client. This will allow us to recall who you are when we receive your email, and answer your question more promptly. Otherwise the email will languish in our Inboxes until we find time to go to the trouble of figuring out why the email was sent...

Please make sure that any question you email to the Instructor or TA does not already have an answer on the class website. Emails containing questions that could have been answered by paying attention to the class website will be ignored.

PREREQUISITE

Prerequisite: MATH 2A (Single-Variable Calculus: Differentiation) and MATH 2B (Single-Variable Calculus: Integration).

TEXT

Calculus: Early Transcendentals, James Stewart, 8th Edition, UCI Custom Edition for Math 2D and Math 2E, 2015 Cengage Learning

Students have the option of purchasing the text in a variety of formats from the UCI Bookstore. You can purchase the book as (1) a custom paperback book just containing the Multivariable Calculus part of the book, (2) a hardback book containing the full Single and Multivariable Calculus text, or (3) an e-copy of the book accessible online or as a one-time download.

PIAZZA

We will use Piazza for discussion of class material. Rather than emailing questions to the instructor/TAs, please post your questions on Piazza. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and the instructor. 

Piazza questions and answers are like Wikipedia: anyone can contribute to them. I encourage you to collaboratively edit questions and answers because these are far easier to read and comprehend than a long thread of comments.

If you have a question about one of the Textbook problems, please write out the question in full (in addition to supplying the question number). This will elicit a speedier reply from Instructors/TAs who don't have the Textbook to hand.

Please do not use Piazza as a medium to haggle for more marks in quizzes and exams. Instead, please follow the procedure outlined below under "Regrading Policy".

Please sign up at: piazza.com/uc_irvine/spring2017/44200 (You will be asked to enter a "Class Access Code", which is 44200.)

If you have any problems or feedback for the developers of Piazza, email team@piazza.com.

GRADING

There will be quizzes (30%) based on the homework assignments, a midterm exam (20%), and a final exam (50%). Percentage scores in the exams and quizzes will be averaged using the indicated weights to compute a percentage score for the entire course.

Students often wonder if there are ways to game the system. Not really. There will be no opportunity for extra credit. More importantly, requests to alter grades will be viewed as an infraction on the part of the student of the university academic honesty policy. It is against University policy to assign a grade based on what the student wants. The grade assigned is the grade that the instructor is obliged to record.

A word of advice. Students often worry about how the course percentage score is translated into a letter grade. Don't. Instead, focus on learning the course material. This is a much better investment of your time. 

QUIZZES AND EXAMS

The quizzes and exams are “closed book” - no books, notes, phones, or calculators. Picture I.D. is required and must be presented upon request.

MAKE-UP POLICY

No make-up quizzes will be given but the two lowest quizzes will be dropped.

It is expected that students will make every effort to attend exams at the scheduled times. Requests for make-ups will be ignored unless:

·       there is a verifiable emergency, which prevents the student from taking the exam at the scheduled time. Such emergencies include, but are not limited to, serious illness, death of immediate family member, or serious accident.

·       there is a timely written petition for a make-up accompanied by verifiable documentary evidence.

TIPS

Please read the indicated sections of the text in advance of the lecture and try to go through the examples presented in the text. You will then come to lecture armed with useful questions and will be better able to absorb the content of the lecture.

The purpose of coming to lectures is more to listen to what's being said rather than to copy what's on the board, especially since the lecture notes are being posted on the class website. Take notes when I'm doing an example. Otherwise listening and watching is the best policy.

Ask questions in class (which is easier to do if you're not slavishly note-taking), and ask questions on Piazza.

You will get the most out of class if you think about the problems being discussed and participate by trying to answer.  After the lecture, while the lecture is still fresh in your mind, you should write your notes out carefully, filling in any gaps and adding any comments you heard in the lecture. If you don't understand what you've written, bring your questions to discussion/office hours.

Some students try homework problems and read the lecture notes or the text only if they get stuck on a question. A better plan is to have a decent grasp of the text and/or lecture notes before tackling the problems.

Try to get comfortable with being confused at first. Even professional mathematicians will tell you that they spend most of their time in a state of confusion. Mathematics is difficult and it often takes some time to absorb it. Accelerate the absorption process by doing your homework and all the examples I put in the lecture notes.

This course (and Math2A and 2B) aims to train you to think logically. Write your answers in a step-by-step fashion, where each step is a logical consequence of the preceding step, i.e. the steps are connected by symbols/words such as 'implies', 'therefore', 'thus'. Often the first step is a 'definition': something that we declare to be the case, and from which we logically derive the solution to the problem.

Here's a way to test whether your answer is logical. Ask yourself two questions:
* Will I understand what I've written in a few weeks?
* Could someone else understand what I've written without my being there to help explain it?
If the answer to both questions is yes, then you can be confident that your answer is logical and, most likely, a valid solution to the problem.

The best way to prepare for the exams is to do all the homework questions, write out the correct solutions to questions you got wrong in the quizzes, write out all the examples presented in the lecture notes (even those not covered in class), and do the previous exams.

A tip about taking exams: when the exam starts, read through the exam questions, identify the easy ones, and do those first. 

Succeeding at this course requires an investment of your time: you should be spending at least as much time studying outside of lectures/discussions as you spend inside, e.g. 5 hours per week in lectures/discussion and 8 hours per week at home or in the library absorbing the concepts and doing the homework questions and practice exam questions. Treat college like a full-time job.

RE-GRADING POLICY

A request to regrade a particular problem will only be considered if an egregious grading error has occurred and will prompt re-consideration of the entire script, which may result in the overall grade going down.  Regrading will NOT be considered once the graded script leaves the classroom. Return the script to your TA immediately when you see the grading mistakes. Your TA will be responsible for regrading of homeworks/quizzes and the instructor will take care of regrading exams.

LETTERS

Requests to write letters will be entertained only if I have spoken with you at length in person multiple times; otherwise emails requesting letters will be ignored. Generally, I  agree to write a letter provided sufficient time has been given to me and a compelling case can be formulated.

ENROLLMENT QUESTIONS

Contact the Math Dept Undergraduate Program Coordinator, Michael Vo, at (949) 824-6770 or myv@uci.edu or 340B Rowland Hall.

ACADEMIC DISHONESTY POLICY

Academic dishonesty will be reported to the Academic Integrity Administrative Office for disciplinary action. Students found guilty of academic dishonesty are subject to penalties ranging from loss of credit for work involved to a grade of F in the course to suspension or probation. The academic dishonesty policy will be enforced in all areas of the course, including quizzes and exams.

Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: copying answers from another student, allowing another student to copy your answers, communicating exam answers to other students during an exam, attempting to use notes or other aids during an exam, or tampering with an exam after it has been corrected and then returning it for more credit. If you do so, you will be in violation of the UCI Policies on Academic Honesty. It is your responsibility to read and understand these policies. You need to avoid even the appearance of impropriety on your exams – keep your eyes on your own exam and do not hold your exam up to look at your answers because students behind you can see your answers.

Homework & Quiz Directions

Questions are taken from the text where they are ordered according to difficulty, with earlier questions being “drill” questions that build proficiency at basic numerical manipulations while later questions are more “conceptual” and test your understanding of the concepts taught in the lectures. Solutions to homeworks can be found at: 

www.slader.com/textbook/9781285741550-stewart-calculus-early-transcendentals-8th-edition/

The homework won't be graded but should be viewed as preparation for the quizzes because students will be quizzed in the Thursday Discussion Sections on questions similar to the homework problems. The material covered in the "Practice Quizzes" (available elsewhere on this page) is not necessarily in sync with the that of the actual Quizzes.

Homework 1 (Quiz on Thu 4/13)

10.1 (Parametric equations): 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 27, 31, 33 (see Ex4 on p641 of Text), 40

Note: The 'slader' solution to 10.3.34 is wrong. There is an additional branch of the curve obtained by reflecting the given curve through the x-axis, as you can see from the the equation of the curve, r = theta^2, which tells us that r doesn't change if theta changes sign.

10.4 (Areas in polar coordinates): 4, 5, 8, 9, 10

Homework 2 (Quiz on Thu 4/20)

12.1 (Coordinate systems): 6, 9-10, 13, 15, 17-18, 22, 37-38
