% {\bf Note that some equations are numbered.}  
You may \textit{not} use your books, notes, or any calculator in this exam. Do not write in the grading table below.\\

The following rules apply to the answers you provide in this exam:

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.7in}
\vspace{0pt}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a neat and coherent way.   

\item \textbf{Unsupported answers will not receive full credit}.  Calculation or verbal explanation is expected. 

\item \textbf{If you need more space, use the back of the pages}; clearly indicate when you have done this.

\item \textbf{Box your final answer} for full credit. 

\end{itemize}
